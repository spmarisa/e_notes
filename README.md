Elixir describes itself as a DYNAMIC, FUNCTIONAL language with immutable state and an actor based approach to concurrency designed for building scalable and maintainable applications with a simple, modern and tidy syntax.

The language runs in the Erlang Virtual Machine, a battle proof, high-performance and distributed virtual machine known for its low latency and fault tolerance characteristics.

Phoenix is a web framework built with the Elixir programming language. Elixir, built on the Erlang VM, is used for building low-latency, fault-tolerant, distributed systems, which are increasingly necessary qualities of modern web applications.
