# Module, record, protocol, and behavior names start with an uppercase letter and are BumpyCase. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter or an underscore, and by convention use underscores between words. If the first character is an underscore, Elixir doesnâ€™t report a warning if the variable is unused in a pattern match or function parameter list.
