TUPLES is an immutable indexed array.

They are fast to return its size and slow to append new values due its immutable nature.

When updating a tuple, you are actually creating a whole new copy of the tuple self.

Tuples are very often used as the return value of an array. While coding in Elixir you will very often see this, {:ok, something_else_here}.
