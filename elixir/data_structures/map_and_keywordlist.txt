Ask yourself these questions (in this order):

• Do I want to pattern-match against the contents (for example, matching
a dictionary that has a key of :name somewhere in it)?
If so, use a map.

• Will I want more than one entry with the same key?
If so, you’ll have to use the Keyword module.

• Do I need to guarantee the elements are ordered?
If so, again, use the Keyword module.

• And, if you’ve reached this point:
Use a map.
