# If itâ€™s necessary to match against multiple patterns we can use case:
case {:ok, "baaaaaa"} do
 {:ok, result} -> result
 {:error} -> "Uh oh!"
 _ -> "Catch all"
end

# The _ variable is an important inclusion in case statements. Without it failure to find a match will raise an error:
case :even do
  :odd -> "Odd"
  _ -> "Not Odd"
end

# Since case relies on pattern matching, all of the same rules and restrictions apply. If you intend to match against existing variables you must use the pin ^ operator:

pie = 3.14
case "cherry pie" do
   ^pie -> "Not so tasty"
   pie -> "I bet #{pie} is tasty"
end

# Another neat feature of case is its support for guard clauses:

# This example comes directly from the official Elixir Getting Started guide.

case {1, 2, 3} do
  {1, x, 3} when x > 0 ->
    "Will match"
   _ ->
    "Won't match"
