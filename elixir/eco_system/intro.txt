we got a lot of building blocks

-> MIX - elixir build tool - it provides more functionality than just compiling an application


-> HEX - package manager




SUPERVISORS - if any unexpected command is passed the system crashes and you just have to restart it
              we are monitoring it and restarting it when it crashes

              in elixir we can specify that other process as supervisor - the only thing this process is
              responsible for is wathing other process and restarting them if they crash


UMBRELLAS - umbrella project is a project that has other elixir projects underneath it
