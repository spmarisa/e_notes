How much we comment and what makes quality documentation remains a contentious issue within the programming world.
However, we can all agree that documentation is important for ourselves and those working with our codebase.

Elixir treats documentation as a first-class citizen, offering various functions to access and generate documentation for your projects. The Elixir core provides us with many different attributes to annotate a codebase. Letâ€™s look at 3 ways:

    # - For inline documentation.
    @moduledoc - For module-level documentation.
    @doc - For function-level documentation.
