# Outputs 'Hello, chum.' to the console.
IO.puts "Hello, " <> "chum."

# Elixir, when running this script will ignore everything from # to the end of the line, treating it as throwaway data. It may add no value to the operation or performance of the script, however when itâ€™s not so obvious what is happening a programmer should know from reading your comment. Be mindful not to abuse the single line comment! Littering a codebase could become an unwelcome nightmare for some. It is best used in moderation.
