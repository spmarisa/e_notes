Metaprogramming Elixir

Introducing Elixir: Getting Started in Functional Programming

"Introduction Erlang" - started reading this book, but switched to "Introduction to Elixir", because I felt that I need only Elixir at that moment.

"Introduction to Elixir" - started reading this book, but switched to "Programming Elixir 1.2"
@pragdave "Programming Elixir 1.2/1.3" - extremely useful.
