Web services are XML-based information exchange systems that use the Internet for direct application-to-application interaction. These systems can include programs, objects, messages, or documents.

a complete web service is, therefore, any service that:

  Is available over the Internet or private (intranet) networks

  Uses a standardized XML messaging system

  Is not tied to any one operating system or programming language

  Is self-describing via a common XML grammar

  Is discoverable via a simple find mechanism





A web service enables communication among various applications by using open standards such as HTML, XML, WSDL, and SOAP. A web service takes the help of:

  XML to tag the data
  SOAP to transfer a message
  WSDL to describe the availability of service.











  WSDL
  WSDL is an XML-based language for describing web services and how to access them.

  WSDL describes a web service, along with the message format and protocol details for the web service.

  UDDI
  UDDI is an XML-based standard for describing, publishing, and finding web services.

  SOAP
  SOAP is a simple XML-based protocol that allows applications to exchange information over HTTP.
