add 2 new pages to pheonix app
One will be a purely static page
the other will take part of the path from the URL as input and pass it through to a template for display


 The first is conn, a struct which holds a ton of data about the request.

 For example, if we point the browser at: http://localhost:4000/hello/Frank, the value of ":messenger" will be "Frank".
