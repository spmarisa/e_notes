files into which we pass data to form complete HTTP responses.

For a web application these responses would typically be full HTML documents. For an API, they would most often be JSON or possibly XML.

The majority of the code in template files is often markup, but there will also be sections of Elixir code for Phoenix to compile and evaluate.

RENDERING TEMPLATES WITHIN TEMPLATES

Templates are just function calls, so like regular code, composing your greater template by small, purpose-built functions can lead to clearer design. This is simply a continuation of the rendering chain we have already seen. Layouts are templates into which regular templates are rendered. Regular templates may have other templates rendered into them.
