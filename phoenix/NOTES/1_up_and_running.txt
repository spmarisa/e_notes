mix phoenix.new hello_phoenix

We are all set! Run your Phoenix application:

    $ cd hello_phoenix
    $ mix phoenix.server

You can also run your app inside IEx (Interactive Elixir) as:

    $ iex -S mix phoenix.server

Before moving on, configure your database in config/dev.exs and run:

    $ mix ecto.create

Phoenix assumes that our PostgreSQL database will have a "postgres" user account with the correct permissions and a password of "postgres". If that isn't the case, please see the instructions for the ecto.create mix task.


cd hello_phoenix

mix ecto.create

And finally, we'll start the Phoenix server:

mix phoenix.server
