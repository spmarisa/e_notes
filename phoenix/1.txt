phoenix is  a web framework for elixir, chris_mccord created it
phoenix and elixir give you both performance and productivity

if you dont understand a error message in elixir it s bug

phoenix - web framework
elixir - programming language
erlang - a programming language and virtual machine that elixir runs on

PRODUCTIVITY

short term - documentation/guides/generators
           - eliminates trivial choices(convention over configuration, like project hierarchy, naming)

log term - maintainability
         - introspection
         - tried and true architecture pattern

we tried to remove middle ware as elixir is functional
a web server abstraction library called plug
plug allows you to write functions where you would normally have middelware

REQUEST LIFE CYCLE

endpoints - can have multiple web servers

routers - router pipeline

controllers


GENERATOTS -

CHANNELS - real time layers


MULTI NODE


Asset build tool - brunch

ES6
ES6
ES6

LIVE RELOADING


VIEWS & TEMPLATES
- precompiled and fast
- views render templates
- views a=serve as a presentation layer


CACHING

ROBUST concurrency model
- "processes" extremely lightweight units of concurrency
- garbage collection is per process
- load balances on IO and CPU

- in elixir we can do CPU bound task and dont have to worry about that
